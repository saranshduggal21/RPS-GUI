# RPS-GUI
Unlike the text-based RPS version, I have created the same game using a new GUI (Graphic User Interface) format.
This project has taught me how to import images within java and use them in order to create a better user experience within the program. Additionally, I have learned how to effectively use Layout Managers, and familiarize myself with types such as, JRadioButton, etc.
Download the images linked with the Java file and place them in the same project folder to avoid any errors.
This has allowed me to expand my knowledge within Java and be able to apply it in ways that would help me reach my goals.
