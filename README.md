# RPS-GUI
Unlike the text-based RPS version, I have created the same game using a new GUI (Graphic User Interface) format.
Download the images linked with the Java file and place them in the same project folder to avoid any errors.
Used within the code are aspects such as Layout Managers, JLabel, JRadioButton, etc.
